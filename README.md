# Cryptographic libarry

The following functions was implemented on this library:

- Generate Key pair (public and private)
- Generate Symmetric key
- Asymmetric Encryption
- Symmetric Encryption
- Asymmetric Decryption
- Symmetric Decryption
- Sign
- verify

Some considerations about the asymmetric and symmetric encryption

- To asymmetric encryption and decryption was used RSA algorithm
- To symmetric encryption and decryption was used AES algorithm


## Requirements

- Maven
- Java
